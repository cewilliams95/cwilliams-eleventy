The Washington Post had neat looking ads showing on reddit for a time, although I can't find a picture of them now. I wanted to see if I could recreate them with HTML/CSS. Here's what I came up with:

<p class="codepen" data-height="800" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="QWXmBao" data-pen-title="WaPo Spotlight  Effect" data-user="chrisNYA" style="height: 800px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/chrisNYA/pen/QWXmBao">
  WaPo Spotlight  Effect</a> by Chris Williams (<a href="https://codepen.io/chrisNYA">@chrisNYA</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
